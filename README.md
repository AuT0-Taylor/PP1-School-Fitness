# School Fitness Website made by Harri Taylor

This is my first Porfolio project - 'School Fitness the lesson's you need'

when starting this project with my limited time schedule i have had to adapt to new ways of thinking, use new technolgy's and trust support for many different sources 

the project was designed with the amboitions to help teachers with lesson planning for school pe this comes from the out cry in school across the uk that find it hard to hit the recommended 120 minutes of excercise a week for a regular student, this comes as no surprise as we are still recovering from the at home lifestyle brought on by covid

    ![contact page](/documents/wireframes/contact-wireframe.png)

- ### Color Scheme
   
   - When picking out a color palette i didn't want it to be to flashy or too bold so i used my image from my first page to create a color scheme that i would use through the rest of the page, this is to give the project a more serious tone, i came to this conclusion after asking colleges in my work what would make them remember a site for work reasons and they made the argument against bright colors as it comes across as not professional to them.

- ### Typography
   
   - My chosen fonts from google had come from research as 'Cabin Sketch' had a studious tone and was most favored by teachers where as 'Madimi One' gave the page a bit more diversity than just give the text a bold decoration

### Issues while validating

-  here i found an issue that ive looked into for a great of time and have come to the conclusion its due to the nature of bootstrap having a veriety of assistive technologies where the validator can not properly access them. 
 ![CSS Check](/documents/validations/validating-issues.png)
 -after looking into this a little deeper i had continued coding the rest of the website as it posed to implication on any level.


## Bug fixes 

### developer story

At the start of this development i had struggled alot with cache errors causing my website not to refresh and in that moment i had copied and pasted work to a new repository : 
[old Repository](https://github.com/AuT0-Taylor/School-Fitness-PP1)
- This was only code with some header html but was the start of what cause much distruption when starting development, as i progreesed more on my current repository as had found that what caused the intial problem, When i had brought a google font in my css files the cache to max out this was incedibly frustrating as it had already been a week since i began designing, at this point i had become desperate to fix this bug, thus created some nonsense commits in this repository like "test, check, please work" looking back at it now i can say i reacted unprofestionally in those commits but still very frustrating to have lost that time.

![example of nonsense commits](/documents/evidence/nonsense-commits.png)

- I solely work on a laptop and am quite new to owning and having access to this level of computing but have come along way from small errors such as this one, Now i have learned to reach out for support for as you will notice through the rest of commits i have stayed in with the 50 character limit whislt staging and grouped my commits appropriatley and have talked to my mentor which was very hopeful upon seeing my improvement.
