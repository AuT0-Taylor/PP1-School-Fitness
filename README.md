# School Fitness Website made by Harri Taylor

This is my first Porfolio project - 'School Fitness the lesson's you need'

when starting this project with my limited time schedule i have had to adapt to new ways of thinking, use new technolgy's and trust support for many different sources 

the project was designed with the amboitions to help teachers with lesson planning for school pe this comes from the out cry in school across the uk that find it hard to hit the recommended 120 minutes of excercise a week for a regular student, this comes as no surprise as we are still recovering from the at home lifestyle brought on by covid

- ### Color Scheme
   
   - When picking out a color palette i didn't want it to be to flashy or too bold so i used my image from my first page to create a color scheme that i would use through the rest of the page, this is to give the project a more serious tone, i came to this conclusion after asking colleges in my work what would make them remember a site for work reasons and they made the argument against bright colors as it comes across as not professional to them.

- ### Typography
   
   - My chosen fonts from google had come from research as 'Cabin Sketch' had a studious tone and was most favored by teachers where as 'Madimi One' gave the page a bit more diversity than just give the text a bold decoration
