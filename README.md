# School Fitness Website made by Harri Taylor

This is my first Porfolio project - 'School Fitness the lesson's you need'

when starting this project with my limited time schedule i have had to adapt to new ways of thinking, use new technolgy's and trust support for many different sources 

the project was designed with the amboitions to help teachers with lesson planning for school pe this comes from the out cry in school across the uk that find it hard to hit the recommended 120 minutes of excercise a week for a regular student, this comes as no surprise as we are still recovering from the at home lifestyle brought on by covid
